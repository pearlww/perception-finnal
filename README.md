# Final Project of 31392 - Perception of Autonomous Systems
## Project Goals
- Calibrate and rectify the stereo input.
- Process the input images to detect objects on the conveyor and track them in 3D, even under occlusion.
- Train a machine learning system that can classify unseen images into 3 classes (cups, books and boxes) based either on 2D or 3D data.

## To Do
- [ ] 4/7/2020-4/14/2020 Calibrate and Rectify the stereo input. 
- [ ] 4/15/2020-4/22/2020 Track objects in 3D even under occlusion.
